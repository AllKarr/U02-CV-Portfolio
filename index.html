            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                Hi, I’m Allen Karromi, an aspiring full-stack developer currently studying at ChasAcademy in Sweden. My journey into tech started with a deep passion for problem-solving and creativity, which led me to spend countless hours learning about web development, coding, and designing websites. I’ve always been curious about how technology can shape the future, and I strive to build solutions that are not only functional but also innovative and user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                Beyond coding, I am someone who thrives on continuous learning. I believe that there’s always something new to explore, whether it’s a new programming language, a design technique, or a better way to solve problems. My calm and collected nature helps me stay focused under pressure, and I enjoy contributing to projects that make a difference.
                </p>

            <h2>Hobby</h2>
                <p>
                My lifestyle is centered around fitness, a passion that drives me to challenge myself physically and mentally. I’m highly engaged in both calisthenics and powerlifting, enjoying the balance between functional body control and raw strength. These routines push my limits, requiring focus, discipline, and resilience—qualities I value deeply. Spending time with my dog is another highlight; our outdoor activities not only keep us active but also strengthen our bond. Together, we hit impressive step counts, explore trails, and share the joys of movement and companionship.
                </p>
                <p>
                Family time is equally important to me. It’s grounding, reminding me to stay connected and appreciate the support system that has always fueled my journey. Each day, I strive to blend physical activity with meaningful moments, knowing that balance between goals and relationships brings the best version of myself. Whether training or relaxing, my focus remains on health, strength, and connection.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>I bring a diverse skill set from a range of technical and customer-facing roles. With a solid background in Information & Media Technology, I spent four years as a machine and CNC operator at Scania, where I honed my precision and problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment. My sales experience, both in-store and via telephone, strengthened my communication abilities and customer service expertise, while my role as a warehouse forklift operator required adaptability and efficient logistical skills. Currently, I’m developing a to-do list application, where I apply my coding skills to build a functional, user-friendly tool for task management. This project showcases my ability to integrate technology with everyday solutions, continuously refining my programming knowledge.</p>
